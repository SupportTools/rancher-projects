# Product Context: Rancher Projects

## Problem Space
Managing Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters in Rancher presents several challenges:
- Manual creation of projects and namespaces is time-consuming and error-prone
- Consistent project structure across clusters requires significant manual effort
- Namespace assignment to projects often involves multiple manual steps
- Automation of these processes typically requires custom scripts or complex API calls

## Solution Approach
The Rancher Projects tool addresses these challenges by providing a simplified CLI interface that:
- Connects to the Rancher API using access credentials
- Creates projects and namespaces as needed
- Associates namespaces with their designated projects
- Supports operations across multiple clusters based on filters
- Generates kubeconfig files for further automation

## User Experience
Users interact with the tool via command-line parameters, providing:
- Rancher server details and authentication credentials
- Target cluster information (name, type, or labels)
- Project and namespace specifications
- Optional flags for creation behavior
- Output configuration options

## Expected Behavior
1. **Authentication**: Verify credentials and establish connection to Rancher server
2. **Cluster Selection**: Identify target cluster(s) based on name, type, or labels
3. **Project Management**: Create or select specified project
4. **Namespace Management**: Create or select specified namespace
5. **Assignment**: Associate namespace with project
6. **Kubeconfig Generation**: Optionally create kubeconfig file for cluster access

## Integration Points
- **Rancher API**: Primary integration for all cluster management operations
- **Kubernetes API**: Indirect integration through Rancher for resource management
- **CI/CD Systems**: Command-line interface allows for pipeline integration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Can be incorporated into automation workflows

## Common Use Cases
1. **Initial Cluster Setup**: Establishing consistent project structure on new clusters
2. **DevOps Automation**: Creating isolated namespaces for development, testing, and production
3. **Multi-tenant Management**: Organizing namespaces into projects for different teams or applications
4. **Cluster Migration**: Recreating project structures when migrating between clusters
