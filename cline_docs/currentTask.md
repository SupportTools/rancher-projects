# Current Task: Rancher Projects

## Recently Completed
- Established Memory Bank documentation system
- Created directory structure for persistent context
- Populated core documentation files with project information

## Current Task
**Task**: Set up comprehensive documentation structure for the Rancher Projects tool

**Subtasks**:
- [x] Create Memory Bank directory structure
- [x] Implement core Memory Bank files:
  - [x] projectbrief.md
  - [x] productContext.md
  - [x] activeContext.md
  - [x] systemPatterns.md
  - [x] techContext.md
  - [x] progress.md
- [x] Implement supplementary documentation:
  - [x] projectRoadmap.md
  - [x] currentTask.md
  - [x] techStack.md
  - [x] codebaseSummary.md

**Progress**: 100% complete

**Blockers**: None

## Context
The Memory Bank system provides persistent context across development sessions for the Rancher Projects tool. This documentation system ensures that any AI assistant working on the project can quickly understand the project's purpose, structure, and current state without needing to rediscover this information in each session.

## Next Steps
1. Review all documentation for consistency and accuracy
2. Consider additional documentation needs specific to the project
3. Update documentation as the project evolves
4. Begin implementing identified improvements or features

## Related Tasks from Roadmap
- "Comprehensive code documentation" from Documentation and Quality section
- "Review and enhance existing code documentation" from Current Priority section

## Notes
- The documentation structure should be considered a living document and updated as the project evolves
- Future development should maintain and expand this documentation to ensure continuity
- Consider automating parts of the documentation updates in future iterations
