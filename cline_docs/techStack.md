# Tech Stack: Rancher Projects

## Core Technology

### Language
- **Go (v1.23.0)**
  - Modern, compiled language with strong typing
  - Excellent performance characteristics
  - Native concurrency support
  - Strong standard library
  - Cross-platform compilation

### Dependencies
- **github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3**
  - Structured logging library
  - Provides multiple log levels
  - Supports various output formats
  - Field-based logging capability

- **github.com/stretchr/testify v1.10.0**
  - Testing framework and assertions
  - Enhances standard Go testing
  - Provides mocking capabilities
  - Simplifies test organization

## Project Structure

### Package Organization
- **main**: Entry point and high-level coordination
- **pkg/config**: Configuration management and CLI parsing
- **pkg/logging**: Centralized logging setup
- **pkg/rancher**: Rancher API interaction logic
- **pkg/version**: Version information and reporting

### Architecture Patterns
- Clear separation of concerns between packages
- Dependency injection for testability
- Command-line driven configuration
- Structured error propagation
- Modular component design

## Build and Deployment

### Build System
- Standard Go build toolchain
- Version information injected via linker flags
- Dockerfile for containerized builds
- GitHub Action for CI/CD integration

### Deployment Options
- Shell script distribution
- Docker container
- GitHub Action
- Direct Go binary compilation

## Development Environment

### Tooling
- Go toolchain (v1.23.0+)
- Git for version control
- Docker for containerization (optional)
- GitHub for collaboration and CI/CD

### Development Workflow
- Feature branch development
- Local testing of functionality
- Commit-based workflow
- CI verification of changes

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Frameworks
- Built-in Go testing package
- Testify for enhanced assertions and mocking
- Potential for integration testing with API mocks

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Focused tests for critical paths
- Opportunity for expanded test coverage

## Operational Environment

### Runtime Requirements
- Direct command-line execution
- Environment with network access to Rancher API
- Valid Rancher API credentials

### Integration Points
- Rancher API for cluster management operations
- Kubernetes API (indirectly through Rancher)
- CI/CD pipelines for automation
- Shell environments for direct execution

## Technology Selection Reasoning

### Go Language
- **Why**: Performance, cross-platform support, simple deployment
- **Alternatives Considered**: Python (more dependencies), Bash (less structured)
- **Tradeoffs**: Learning curve for Go vs. wider adoption of alternatives

### Logrus for Logging
- **Why**: Structured logging, multiple levels, flexible output
- **Alternatives Considered**: Standard library log (limited features)
- **Tradeoffs**: Additional dependency vs. enhanced capability

### CLI-Based Interface
- **Why**: Scriptability, automation support, simple integration
- **Alternatives Considered**: Web UI, API server
- **Tradeoffs**: Limited interactivity vs. easier automation

### Deployment Approach
- **Why**: Multiple options for different use cases
- **Alternatives Considered**: Single deployment method
- **Tradeoffs**: Maintenance of multiple methods vs. flexibility for users
